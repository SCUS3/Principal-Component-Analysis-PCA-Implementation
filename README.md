# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and variance analysis. PCA is a powerful statistical technique used to identify patterns in data by transforming it into a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) components, ranked by the amount of variance they explain.
